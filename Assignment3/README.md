# Assignment 3 #
In Assignment 2, we learnt how to construct networks of spiking neurons and propagate information through a network of fixed weights. In this assignment, you will learn how to train network weights for a given task using brain-inspired learning rules.

* The environment setup [readme file on homepage](../README.md) is same as that in the first and second assignment. 

* Download the jupyter notebook titled "Assignment3_Questions.ipynb" on the ilab machine (if using ilab), or your local machine.

* The assignment is a mix of conceptual and coding questions. 
    * Implement your code in the space provided in the cells in the Jupyter notebook. 
    * Write your answers to the conceptual questions in the space provided in the Jupyter notebook. Please use the Markdown formatting to enter your answers. You can find the basic Markdown syntaxes here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
   
* You will submit the completed jupyter notebook on Canvas. Please note that we will NOT accept any additional code files, PDFs, etc. We will only grade your jupyter notebook. So make sure that the submitted notebook is self-contained and has all your answers. We will also NOT accept any late submissions, for any reason (including mysterious late-submission system glitches), unless there is a good reason for such a delay, that will be communicated to us well in advance (e.g., days before the due date.)
