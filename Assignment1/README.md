# Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to develop an understanding of how the brain performs computations at the neuronal level. To do so, you will develop several models of a spiking neuron. By the end of this assignment, you should

- be comfortable with developing models of spiking neurons at different levels of abstraction, from the biologically plausible Hodgkin-Huxley model to the phenomenological LIF model;
- understand how neurons use their firing rate to represent continuous-valued information;
- understand the trade-offs involved in spike-based information representation.

1. First, follow the instructions in the [readme file on homepage](../README.md) to set up the environment.

2. Download the jupyter notebook titled "Assignment1_Questions.ipynb" on the ilab machine (if using ilab), or your local machine.

3. The assignment is a mix of conceptual and coding questions.

   - Implement your code in the space provided in the cells in the Jupyter notebook.
   - Write your answers to the conceptual questions in the space provided in the Jupyter notebook. Please use the Markdown formatting to enter your answers. You can find the basic Markdown syntaxes here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

4. You will submit the completed jupyter notebook on Canvas. Please note that we will **NOT** accept any additional code files, PDFs, etc. We will only grade your jupyter notebook. So make sure that the submitted notebook is self-contained and has all your answers. We will also NOT accept any late submissions, for any reason (including mysterious late-submission system glitches), unless there is a good reason for such a delay, that will be communicated to us well in advance (e.g., days before the due date.)
