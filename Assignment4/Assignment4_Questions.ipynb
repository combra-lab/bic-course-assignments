    "# Learning Goals\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to use the knowledge gained in the course to develop an end-to-end SNN for MNIST digits classification trained using state-of-the-art gradient-descent algorithm. Along the way, you will also learn the basics of developing any machine learning application- how to handle data using data loaders; defining and optimizing loss; evaluating an algorithm using validation set; speeding up training using GPUs. You will also learn the basics of programming using PyTorch which is by far the most widely used library for machine learning research- being used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotic control, cancer research, and much more!\n",

The forward function simply performs the forward pass, i.e. computing output tensors from the input tensors. The backward function receives the gradient of the output tensors w.r.t. some scalar value, and computes the gradient of the input tensors w.r.t. the same scalar value. \n",

    "If you have been able to implement all the parts in Q.1.-Q.5., you can now feel proud of yourself for having learned the basics of a deep learning pipeline that powers all the modern AI applications. Of course, the exact implementation varies in the input and network design for more complex applications, but the pipeline remains the same. In fact, we went beyond the conventional deep learning, and implemented a spiking deep learning algorithm which is not a skill that many people possess. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know the basic implementation, there are lots of directions which you can pursue if you are interested in this research area- how do the hyper-parameters such as the pseudo-gradient window affect the network training process? How much training data do you need to achieve good performance? How does the amount of training data vary with the complexity of the task? To what limits can you push the spike encoding, i.e. what is the minimum timesteps you need to achieve good performance? \n",
