    "# Question 5: Tuning Membrane Properties for Correct Classification \n",
    "Great! We have everything that we need to measure the performance of the SNN for classification of MNIST digits. For this, we first need to create the SNN using the class definition we wrote in Q.3. Then we need to call the test function that we wrote in Q.4b. However, note that the SNN needs the connection weights between the layers as inputs. These weights are typically obtained as a result of \"training\" the network for a given task (such as MNIST classification). However, since training the network isn't a part of this assignment, we provide to you already trained weights. \n",
