By the end of this assignment, you should a) be comfortable with developing models of spiking neurons at different levels of abstraction, from the biologically plausible H-H model to the phenomenological LIF model; b) understand how neurons use their firing rate to represent continuous-valued information; and c) understand the trade-offs involved in spike-based information representation. \n",

First let's see what a sample digit from the MNIST image looks like. For this, we need to create a loader for the MNIST dataset using a Pytorch function called datasets.MNIST. You do not need to know what a loader is for now. Just understand the two important arguments of the function: The first argument is the directory where the MNIST dataset will be downloaded. The third argument is the set download option. This should be true for the first time when you run this cell to allow you to download the MNIST data into your directory. You can set it to false if the MNIST data has already been downloaded. "
