# Assignment 1 #
The goal of this assignment is to develop an understanding of how to perform computations using a spiking neuron. By the end of this assignment, you should a) be comfortable with developing models of spiking neurons at different levels of abstraction; b) understand how to represent continuous-valued information using spiking neurons; c) understand the trade-offs involved in spike-based information representation. 

* First, follow the instructions in the readme file on homepage (../README.md) to set up the environment. 

* Download the jupyter notebook titled "Assignment1_Questions.ipynb" on the ilab machine (if using ilab), or your local machine. 

* The assignment is a mix of conceptual and coding questions. 
    * Implement your code in the space provided in the cells in the Jupyter notebook. 
    * Write your answers to the conceptual questions in the space provided in the Jupyter notebook. 
   
* You will submit the completed jupyter notebook on Canvas. Please note that we will NOT accept any additional code files, PDFs, etc. We will only grade your jupyter notebook. So make sure that the submitted notebook is self-contained and has all your answers.
